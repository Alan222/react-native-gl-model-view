A `<GLModelView>` component for [react-native](github.com/facebook/react-native/), allowing you to
display and animate any Wavefront .OBJ 3D object. Realized with a native bridge to [GLView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView).

Main features:

* Display, rotate, scale and translate any textured 3D object!
* Animate with blasting fast 60FPS by using the [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html#using-the-native-driver) native driver
* Load any Wavefront .OBJ or GLEssentials model
* Use all texture image formats supported by [UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/LoadingImages/LoadingImages.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010156-CH17-SW8)
