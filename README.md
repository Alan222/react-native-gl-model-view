# react-native-gl-model-view

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-gl-model-view.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-gl-model-view)
![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view.svg)
![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view.svg)

A `<ModelView>` component for [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), allowing you to
display and animate any Wavefront .OBJ 3D object. Realized with a native bridge to [GLView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView).

<img src="docs/AnimatedAPI.gif" width="32%"/> <img src="docs/GestureResponder.gif" width="32%"/> <img src="docs/Multiple.gif" width="32%" />

Main features:

* Display, rotate, scale and translate textured 3D models!
* Animate with blasting fast 60 fps by using the [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html#using-the-native-driver) native driver
* Supports [Wavefront .OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) and GLEssentials model formats
* Supports all texture image formats supported by [UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/LoadingImages/LoadingImages.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010156-CH17-SW8)

## Requirements

* iOS - feel free to PR an Android port ;)
* Cocoapods - to install the [GLView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView) dependency.

## Getting started

You can install and try linking the project automatically:

`$ react-native add react-native-gl-model-view`

or do it manually as described below:

### Manual installation

`$ npm install --save react-native-gl-model-view`

Afterwards add following lines to your Podfile:

```sh
pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native'
pod 'RNGLModelView', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-gl-model-view/ios'
```

## Usage

### Static

```javascript
import ModelView from 'react-native-gl-model-view';

<ModelView
    model="model.obj"
    texture="texture.png"

    scale={0.01}

    translateZ={-2}
    rotateZ={270}

    style={{flex: 1}}
/>
```

### Animated

Make the `<ModelView>` animatable by wrapping it around the Animated API.

```javascript
import ModelView from 'react-native-gl-model-view';
import { Animated, Easing } from 'react-native';

const AnimatedModelView = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(ModelView);
```

As this usage of the Animated API is ***kinda*** hacky, you must call the private `__makeNative()` method on all `Animated.Values` before using `Animated.multiply` and such.

```javascript
constructor() {
    this.state = {
        zoom: new Animated.Value(0),
        // ...
    };
    Object.keys(this.state).forEach(key =>
        this.state[key] instanceof Animated.Value &&
        this.state[key].__makeNative()
    );
}
```

Now you can apply all the Animated API magic to the `<AnimatedModelView>`'s props.
```javascript
render() {
    <AnimatedModelView
        ...
        animate={true}
        translateZ={this.state.zoom}
    />
}
componentDidMount() {
    Animated.timing(this.state.zoom, {
        toValue: -2,
        useNativeDriver: true,
        duration: 2000,
        easing: Easing.bounce
    }).start();
}
```

### Properties

| Prop  | Default  | Type | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------:| :---------------:| :-----|
| model | *required* | `string` | Filename of the model, must be included via Xcode |
| texture | undefined | `string` | Filename of the texture, must be included via Xcode |
| animate | false | `bool` | Model re-renders each 1/60s when set to `true` |
| scale | 1 | `number` | Scale all axes of the model by given factor (overwrites scale*) |
| scaleX | 1 | `number` | Scale X axis by given factor |
| scaleY | 1 | `number` | Scale Y axis by given factor |
| scaleZ | 1 | `number` | Scale Z axis by given factor |
| rotateX | 0 | `number` | Rotate around X axis by given degree |
| rotateY | 0 | `number` | Rotate around Y axis by given degree |
| rotateZ | 0 | `number` | Rotate around Z axis by given degree |
| translateX | 0 | `number` | Translate X position by given points |
| translateY | 0 | `number` | Translate Y position by given points |
| translateZ | 0 | `number` | Translate Z position by given points |
