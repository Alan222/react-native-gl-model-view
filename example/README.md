# GLModelView Examples

To build it, switch into this folder and set it up as following:

## iOS

```sh
$ npm install
$ cd ios
$ pod install
$ cd ..
$ react-native run-ios
```

## Android

```sh
$ npm install
$ react-native run-android
```

Note: Sometimes, the `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android` commands fail to automatically launch the development server. If you get a "No bundle URL present" error message, open a new console window and type `npm start` in the example folder. This will launch the development server and let you successfully run the Android or ios builds wit
h their respective commands.
